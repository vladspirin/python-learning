# Write a program that takes an integer number x and prints e (a mathematical constant) raised to power x, minus one. Use the function expm1 defined in the math module.
# The variable x is already defined.
# Sample Input 1:
# -57
# Sample Output 1:
# -1.0
from math import expm1


number = int(input())
print(expm1(number))
